# MDLZ-Pallet-Simulation
Comprehensive simulation of pallet flow through the US CS&amp;L network, including a pallet return program. This initiative was sponsored by Michael Hall in order to simulate and detail the Mondelez network with the use of new and improved pallets that will roll out early 2024.
